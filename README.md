# CodeForum
For programming discussions

## Format
Look at [this example](example1.md) to see if you like the format. The idea is that at the bottom you can add comments, we'll see how easy this is.

## Categories
So far I've just created the [Code Review](code_review) category. Some of the other categories we could add might be Q&A and General (for general programming discussion). I'm not sure if we want to get much more specific than that because for every topic we'll have to add new folders, which isn't actually that hard if it's beneficial that way.
